# Intellivoid Translations

Many of our web applications and software that offers some sort
of user-interface, may provide some sort of a multi-language
feature. This repository allows volunteers to contribute by
correcting existing translations or submitting new translations.

Volunteers that contributes the majority of the translation works
can be expected to be credited one way or another once the
translation gets pushed the final product.

Each directory contains a readme file on instructions to
translating, what to do and what not to do.

## Want to contribute?

Please use our [Crowdin](https://crowdin.intellivoid.net) for future translations.
